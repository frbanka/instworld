            Every single donate will be listed on this website (on Hall of Fame
            page) - with a donors name, nick, instagram nickname, link to your
            youtube channel, link to any of your social profile (even your OF
            page) - whatever you leave me in the donate feedback. <br></br>

            My wife told me, that this experiment cannot have the character of
            crowdfunding or alms
          </p>
          <p className="h4 p5">
            In other words, I need to tell you this: I'm not poor, I'm not
            begging for money, I'm not gonna create or sell anything here and
            I'm not trying to trick you, extort money from you. I do not
            organize any services here, this is not a financial pyramid or
            business proposal. This is not charity collection, I don't work for
            any commercial company, any advertising or model agency. All I mean
            is that you can do whatever you want - you can participate to this
            experiment by donating or don't.
          </p>
