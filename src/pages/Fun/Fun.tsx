            My wife noticed, that this project cannot have the character of
            crowdfunding or worst - the alms
          </p>
          <p className="h5 p5">
            In other words, I need to tell you this: I'm not poor, I'm not
            begging for money, I'm not trying to trick you, extort money from
            you, you won't get any goods from me (except some gifts described in
            the goals). I do not offer any services here, this is not a
            financial pyramid or business proposal. I am not organising any
            lottery, now or later. This is not charity collection, I don't work
            for any commercial company, any advertising or model agency or
            television. I do not cooperate with any of well-known media person.
            This project was only my idea. All this means, that you can (by your
            choice) donate some money on this website, but don't expect nothing
            in return. Some things I described and promised to do in The Goals
            page may not be done due to the unforeseen events. But I can promise
            to do my best to keep my word on that. You can participate to this
            project not only by donating, but by sharing this page, sharing my
            posts or following my Instagram account

            Some time ago I have created several pieces of music (I used them in
            my small game-project) and I am giving them for free on this
            website. So you can now support me for my work! Feel free to use it.
