            Especially, things I want to buy using donated money. Things that
            will change my life, my family and my friends life. And you will see

            Coming up with the Goals I wanted it to be something that makes this

            You will be able to follow their realization on my social media
            profiles.<br></br>It will be in a form of photo or video.
          </p>
          <p className="p5 h4">
            I am open to ideas.<br></br>Write to me what I can do or buy - the
            most repeatable ideas will be added

        <div className="worksection5">
          <p className="p4 h3">Starting with 10$</p>

            <ul className="h5">
              <li>
                What I will do with 10$? Not much, you say?<br></br>FALSE! It is
                very important goal!
                <br></br>I will use this 10$ some day to buy postards. Yes,
                postcards.<br></br>After the 10.000$ goal will be reached, the
                first donators will receive a personal gift from me, including a
                postcard sent from the first vacation I will go to. And then,
                what is more important, I will meet with them in person - this
                last one will be done after experiment end (1 million $
                reached).<br></br>The first donations that sums up to 10$ will
                get the reward (if the very first donation will be 10$ - then
                this one person wins, if there will be 5 donations of 2$ - five
                persons wins etc.).
                <br></br> But here's the catch.
                <br></br>The first update of The Money Counter will be done
                after it reaches 500$ - so till then nobody will know how many
                donations were made and anybody still can be the first one and
                win.
