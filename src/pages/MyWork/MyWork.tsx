            I am not sure if we will reach a million or just few bucks.. but
            maybe we will reach even more, like few millions.. Thats why I came

                What I will do with 10$? Not much, you say..?<br></br>FALSE!
                <br></br>I will use it to buy postards. Yes, postcards. After
                the experiment end, the first donators will receive a personal
                gift from me, including a postcard sent from the first vacation
                I will go to, and, what is more important, I will meet with them
                in person (we'll work out the details later).<br></br>Let's say
                - the first donations that reaches 10$ (if the very first
                donation will be 10$ - then this one person wins, if there will
                be 5 donations of 2$ - five persons wins).<br></br> But here's
                the catch.<br></br>I will update The Money Counter after it
                reaches 500$ - so till then everybody can be that first donation
                - either you are the first or there was many others before you
